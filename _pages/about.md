I'm a philosopher and cognitive scientist engaged in both theoretical and experimental research in embodied cognitive science. The primary focus of my research is on the implications of embodiment for how we make sense of "higher cognition" and technologically-supported problem solving, including in scientific practice. My main influences are the scientific traditions of Gibsonian ecological psychology and dynamical systems theory, and the philosophical traditions of pragmatism and phenomenology.




About me
======

I am a "Saavedra Fajardo" researcher at the University of Murcia (Spain), where I'm affiliated to the <a href="https://portalinvestigacion.um.es/grupos/31905/detalle" target="_blank">Myrtos group</a> in the <a href="https://www.um.es/web/dp-filosofia/" target="_blank">Department of Philosophy</a>, and lead the project _**Embodied cognitive science and scientific expertise in reading (ECSSER)**_ funded by the Fundación Séneca / Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnología de la Región de Murcia (project number 22831/SF/24).

Previously, I spent over five years (from 2020 to 2025) as an assistant lecturer and researcher ("Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter") in the <a href="https://www.bpn.tu-berlin.de/menue/biological_psychology_and_neuroergonomics/parameter/en/" target="_blank">Department of Biological Psychology and Neuroergonomics</a> at Technische Universität Berlin (Germany), where I founded and led the <a href="https://embody-rg.github.io/" target="_blank">EMBODY Research Group</a> (the name stands for _**E**xploring **M**ind and **B**ehavior in **O**rganism-environment **DY**namics_). In 2019 I received my PhD in philosophy from the University of Cincinnati (USA), working with <a href="https://www.angelapotochnik.com/" target="_blank">Angela Potochnik</a> as my supervisor and with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-RAPSx4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Tony Chemero</a> as an additional mentor. I earned a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in philosophy from the University of São Paulo (Brazil) under <a href="https://filosofia.fflch.usp.br/en/professores/osvaldo-frota-pessoa-junior" target="_blank">Osvaldo Frota Pessoa Jr</a>, and I was a visiting master's student for two semesters with <a href="https://mbb.harvard.edu/people/nancy-nersessian" target="_blank">Nancy Nersessian</a> at the Georgia Institute of Technology and for one semester in the Philosophy Department at Georgia State University (USA).

For 6 years during our time in Cincinnati, my wife and I had a backyard farm with <a href="https://gui-cogsci.github.io/images/goats2016.jpg" target="_blank">miniature dairy goats</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gui.br/videos/10209876057245259/?l=6129363546072657550" target="_blank">rabbits</a>, <a href="https://gui-cogsci.github.io/images/chickens2015.jpg" target="_blank">chickens</a>, and a vegetable garden. Our time as urbanites in Berlin marked the beginning of a new big project, <a href="https://gui-cogsci.github.io/images/airportfamily2020.jpg" target="_blank">~~raising a human being~~</a> <a href="https://gui-cogsci.github.io/images/familyaustralia2023.jpg" target="_blank">raising two human beings</a>. Now in Spain we're happy to be working the land again, taking the first steps toward creating a syntropic food forest.
